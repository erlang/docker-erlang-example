# About


This file contains a step-by-step guide that demonstrates how one can
create a compact docker image containing a small service written in
Erlang. More complex docker examples can be found in the
[advanced_examples](advanced_examples) folder.


## Create a Docker Image Using Alpine Linux

In this example we create a docker image containing a small Erlang
application.



We use the following Dockerfile, containing two build stages:

```Dockerfile
# Build stage 0
FROM erlang:alpine

# Install Git if necessary
RUN apk add git

# Set working directory
RUN mkdir /buildroot
WORKDIR /buildroot

# Copy our Erlang test application
COPY dockerwatch dockerwatch

# And build the release
WORKDIR dockerwatch
RUN rebar3 as prod release

# Build stage 1
FROM alpine

# Install some libs
RUN apk add --no-cache openssl && \
    apk add --no-cache ncurses-libs && \
    apk add --no-cache libstdc++

# Install the released application
COPY --from=0 /buildroot/dockerwatch/_build/prod/rel/dockerwatch /dockerwatch

# Expose relevant ports
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 8443

CMD ["/dockerwatch/bin/dockerwatch", "foreground"]
```

The image is built with the following command:

    $ docker build -t erlang-dockerwatch .

Notice that if you need a proxy to access the internet, you must
forward your proxy settings to docker, for example by giving the option
`--build-arg https_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY` to `docker build`.

This is what happens:

#### 1. Build stage 0: build

This step starts from the official erlang docker image based on alpine
linux. So with the base image, a full Erlang/OTP installation and rebar3
already exists.

Our Erlang application is found in the `dockerwatch` directory on our
local filesystem, and we use the `COPY` command to import this
complete directory into the current working directory in the image.

Finally, we release our erlang application using rebar3 and the
following rebar.config.

```erlang
{deps, [{jsone,  "1.4.7"},   %% JSON Encode/Decode
        {cowboy, "2.5.0"}]}. %% HTTP Server

{relx, [{release, {dockerwatch, "1.0.0"}, [dockerwatch]},
        {vm_args, "config/vm.args"},
        {sys_config, "config/sys.config"},
        {dev_mode, true},
        {include_erts, false},
        {extended_start_script, true}
    ]}.

{profiles, [{prod, [{relx, [{dev_mode, false},
                            {include_erts, true},
                            {include_src, false}]}]}
           ]}.
```

#### 2. Build stage 1: create a minimal docker image

Now that our application is released, we can discard all extras that
was needed for compilation. That is, we no longer need rebar3 or the
full Erlang/OTP installation, since our release already contains the
required parts of Erlang/OTP, including the runtime system. So, we
start a new build stage from the apline linux docker image.

Using the `COPY` command with option `--from=0`, we specify that we
want to copy artifacts from build stage 0 into the current build
stage. We use this to copy our released Erlang application into the
final image.

We expose the relevant ports (needed by our application), and specify
the command to execute when running the image.



## What happened?

    $ docker images
	REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
	erlang-dockerwatch   latest              fcdd1aaa2ee7        16 seconds ago      26MB
        ...

The final docker image for the application has a size of approximately
26MB. It may be useful to know that one can get down the image size
for this application even further (to approximately 13MB) by using
some tricks (e.g., compiling the Erlang release without the ncurses
library, stripping away debug symbols from binaries and compressing
applications). An alternative docker file, which is named
[Dockerfile.very_small_image](Dockerfile.very_small_image), illustrates
how this can be done.

## Generating Certificate

Generate certificates in subdirectory `ssl`.

    $ ./create-certs

For some more details of what this command does, see [README-CERTS.md](README-CERTS.md)

## Running the Erlang Application

We start the image in a docker container by issuing the following command.

    $ docker run -d -p 8443:8443 --init --volume="$PWD/ssl:/etc/ssl/certs" --log-driver=syslog erlang-dockerwatch
    870f979c5b4cdb7a1ba930b020043f50fa7457bf787237706fb27eefaf5fe61d

Let's parse some of the input.

 * `-d`, starts the container in the background and prints the container ID.
 * `-p 8443:8443`, exposes port `8443` from the container to our localhost.
 * `--init`, use the tini initialization as PID 1 in order to prevent zombie processes.
 * `--volume="$PWD/ssl:/etc/ssl/certs"`, mounts our local directory
   (`$PWD/ssl`) with certificates to `/etc/ssl/certs` the container.
 * `--log-driver=syslog`, will log all data from stdout in the container to our local syslog.

In `/var/log/syslog` we can see these entries:

And here is our docker container:

    $ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES

Fetch container IP Address from container id:

    $ docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 870f979c5b4c
